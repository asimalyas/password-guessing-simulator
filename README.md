## 🚀 Project Overview

**Password Guessing Simulator** demonstrates how a brute-force style password attack works by randomly generating characters until the correct password is guessed.

⚠️ **Educational Use Only**  
This project is intended to help learners understand password security concepts.

## 🛡️ Disclaimer
> ❗ This project does **NOT** hack real accounts or systems.  
> ❗ Do **NOT** use this code for illegal or unethical activities.

---

## ✨ Features
- 🔑 User-defined password input  
- 🎲 Random password generation  
- 🔁 Continuous guessing simulation  
- ⏱️ Time tracking  
- 🔢 Attempt counter  
- 🖥️ Console-based visualization  

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User enters a password  
2. Program stores all possible characters  
3. Random guesses are generated with the same length  
4. Each guess is compared to the original password  
5. Loop continues until the password matches  
6. Final password, total attempts, and time taken are displayed

## 🔐 Security Awareness

Real-world systems protect passwords using:
- Hashing (bcrypt, SHA‑256)  
- Salting  
- Rate limiting  
- Account lockout mechanisms  
- CAPTCHA  

💡 This project highlights why **strong passwords matter**.

---

## 📈 Future Improvements
- Full character set (A–Z, a–z, symbols)  
- Optimized guessing logic  
- Progress bar  
- GUI version  
- Hash-based password simulation
